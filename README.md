# MarkBook

Yet another songbook app (that's my third attempt). I've been pondering this concept for a long time now, and the idea now is to consolidate an opinionated app, with a minimalistic design and a concise set of features that just works, out of the box.

The field of app development went a long way since my last attempt, and now I chose to realize it in flutter.

The idea is to make operation as simple as possible, with the shallowest learning curve. Chords are generated on the fly, and the best possible fingering for each song is chosen automatically.
