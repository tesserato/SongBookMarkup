|D                           |D7 
There is a house down in New Orleans 
    |G               |D 
They call the Rising Sun  
|D                           |G 
And it's been the ruin of a many poor boy 
    |D      |A         |D 
And me, oh God , for one 
 
|D                        |D7 
Then fill the glasses to the brim 
       |G                  |D 
Let the drinks go merrily around 
|D                                  |G 
And we'll drink to the health of a rounder poor boy 
    |D         |A7       |D 
Who goes from town to town
